These are sources for various Thomson stuff. I'm not sure who gathered them
together, they were originally in 6809 language module format (non-ASCII source
files). Tomix helped convert them to a more useful ASCII version.

I tried to make some sense of what's in there and create some relevant
subdirectories. I'm not sure how much of this can be compiled into something
useable, but some of the sources can show useful tricks, anyway.

Enjoy!
