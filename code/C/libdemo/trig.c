/**
 * Generate an approximation of a sine wave using a polynomial (x-3)Â²-1.
 * http://codebase64.org/doku.php?id=base:generating_approximate_sines_in_assembly
 *
 * Output is unsigned 8bit, in the range 0-255.
 * Deviates from an actual sinewave by about 6%, which is ok for dirty trig, but
 * also more interesting when you derive (get a triangle) or integrate. So this
 * adds some distorsion which is nice for plasma curves, and so on.
 *
 * Call this once, then use the SIN table to lookup your samples. We *should* be
 * using a signed char as an offset in the table, which could be used to make
 * this code a bit more 6809 optimized. For now we don't...
