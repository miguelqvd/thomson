Picture converter from PNG to MO5 picture.

The input must be a PNG input file of 320x200 pixels, with 16 colors or less.
The palette is assumed to be the MO5 one.

The MO5 has block constraints on 8x1 blocks, 2 colors by block.
If a conflict ('color clash') occurs, the software tells you at which pixel.
The conversion goes on anyway.

The output format is a binary file in MO5 format.
It has 4 chunks :

First and third one are to switch between FORME and COULEUR ram pages, they
write one bit each to the PIA (A7C0).

Second and fourth blocks are 8000 bytes long, second is the FORME and fourth is
COULEUR.
