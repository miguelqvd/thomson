# thomson

This repo holds tools and software I write (or gather) for Thomson computers.
These were designed and built by the French company Thomson in 1982-1986, and there is a small community
of enthusisats around them.

I write tools for cross-development as well as some scene demos. There may someday be games or native tools
as well. Occasionally I hack on hardware expansions.
