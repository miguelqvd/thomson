History
=======
Thomson company
---------------
* 1879: Thomson-Houston Electric Company created in the USA (would become part of General Electric).
* 1892: French sub-company (CFTH) created, exploits Thomson-Houston patents on electricity transport and production
* XXth century: the French company becomes independant from GE, and spawns a lot of subcompanies itself:
- Railways and tramways (ALSTOM)
- Batteries and light bulbs (Mazda)
- Refrigerators and washing machines (Brandt)
- Sewing machines, movie projectors, weapons (also Brandt)
- Semiconductors (EFCIS, will become ST Microelectronics after merge with Italian SGS)
* 1981: Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF are nationalized, mostly because the French army needs a reliable supplier of weapons and semiconductors

Thomson contributed to various research areas, including radars, video discs,
magnetrons, eurovision, and more.

Computers in France
-------------------
Since WWII and the help from USA for getting out of it, France tries to be independant from the USA as much as possible
* Limits on the number of movies imported from the US, keeping French-made ones
* Avoidance of the English language (it's still forbidden to do courses in English in French universities!)

And some things more relevant to microcomputers:
* Somewhat high taxes on imported products
* US companies can't easily create a French spin-off
- Nothing like the german Commodore company
* Custom standards: SECAM TV modulation, AZERTY keyboards, SCART connector on TVs

This makes France a good place to start a computer company.
* Other French manufacturers: Matra, Exelvision, SMT, Logabax, Micronique, and more...


The "Plan Informatique Pour Tous"
---------------------------------
French government decides to install a computer room in every French school
* The requirements are designed to help French manufacturers
- SCART connector, AZERTY keyboard, LSEG language (BASIC clone with French keywords)
- No foreign company wants to bother with this
- Matra, Thomson and Exelvision have a try
- Thomson manages to reuse the MO5 computer with few changes (it needs a network adapter and RAM expansion), and a Logabax or SMT computer as a server.
- The two others came with (more expansive) original designs.
- Almost all schools will get the Thomson solution.

Machines
========

Common information
------------------
Quite powerful operating system with graphic menu, multi-byte characters support (for French accents).
Later model came with built-in office suite.

* Custom design, not MSX compatible.
* CPU: 6809E, 1MHz
* 16KB video memory in two bitplanes

The choice of 6809E is because Thomson-EFCIS was already manufacturing Motorola
compatible chips for the French army. Thomson employees had easy access to those.
Other French companies often went with 68xx-based designs.

Early prototypes designed by José Henrard (economist and sociologist) in 1979.

TO7
---
* Date: 1982
* RAM: 8K x 8bits (system), 8K x 14bits (video)
* ROM: 6K (in 6846 PIA)
* Video modes: 320x200, 8 colors, 8x1 attribute blocks

Goal: an Apple ][ à la française
* Video circuit built only with standard 74LS logic chips.
* Uses (expensive) static RAM
* Lightpen and graphical boot menu
* The custom tape drive does signal decoding and provides a bit stream to load in memory directly
* Memory expansion up to 32K system RAM
* Capacitive keyboard (no moving parts!)
* Comes with a lightpen.
* BASIC is stored in a cartridge
* The video RAM is split in an 8-bit bank for pixels, and a 6-bit bank for colors.

TO7/70
------
* Date: 1984
* 64K RAM, extensible to 128K
* 6K ROM (in 6846 PIA)
* 8-bit color RAM allowing for 16 colors

Hardware update.
* Now uses a gate array for video generation
* Uses (cheaper) DRAM
* BASIC is stored in a cartridge - a new version is needed to use the extra RAM.
* QDD is available as a storage medium.
* Soft membrane keyboard

MO5 and MO5E
------------
* Date: 1984
* ROM: 16K (dedicated chip)
* RAM: 48K

New design, drops TO compatibility.
Goal: A ZX Spectrum à la Française
* Removes 6846 PIA with built-in timer and ROM
* Simplified memory layout for simpler decoding
* Fixes some design bugs
* No graphical menu, but will autoboot cartridges and floppydisks.
* Built-in BASIC
* Some tricks to keep hardware expansions compatible with the TO range.
* Improved (faster and safer) tape coding format, done in software this time.
* First generation machines can't get a memory expansion, second revision makes it possible to add 64K using the cartridge port.
* About 500 000 machines were made.

TO9
---
* Date: 1985
* 128K RAM
* 136K ROM (!)
* Disk drive (3.5" - second drive can be added)
* PC-Like desktop case with detached keyboard (but all plastic)
* Finally a real keyboard! (the MO5 and TO7/70 will be upgraded to get one, too)

Goal: an Apple Macintosh à la Française (yes, you're startingto get it)
* Still 8-bit, still 1MHz!
* New video modes, similar to Amstrad CPC:
- 640x200 in 2 colors,
- 320x200 in 4 colors,
- 160x200 in 16 colors
* 4096 color palette (with unusual Gamma curve)

Integrates most expansion available for earlier models:
* 6-bit audio DAC supplements buzzer (available as an expansion for previous models)
* Joystick/mouse ports
* Parallel port
* 3 expansion ports on the back

The price is too high for an 8-bit machine, and the built-in software has bugs.

TO8, MO6, MO5NR, TO9+ and TO8D
------------------------------
* Date: 1986
* RAM: 128K (MO), 256K (TO8) or 512K (TO9+)
* ROM: 80K (TO) / 64K (MO)

Goal: An Atari ST à la Française (I've already heard that somewhere...)
* Still 8-bit, still 1MHz!
* Unified Gate Array: a single chip is used for all the machines
* More flexibility: RAM banking, 60Hz video modes
* Even more video modes (bitplane-like)
* The TO8 lacks a built-in disk drive. The TO8D will fix this (it's the only difference)
* The MO6 has a built-in tape drive.
* The MO5NR is designed for Nanoréseau operation and has no built-in storage device.
* MO5NR and MO6 can be extended to 192K memory, TO8 ad TO8D to 512K
* The MO family gets a boot menu, after all.

TO9+ has a built-in modem to act as a Minitel server (French BBS-like system)
* Software moves back to floppies to allow updates (but can be loaded to a RAM disk)

Later
-----
European standard attempt
* Team with Olivetti and Acorn to build an european answer to the MSX standard (in 16-bit)
* Olivetti sold some machines based on Thomson designs
* Nothing more came out of this

The Théodore project
* A 16-bit machine based on 68000
* OS/9 system, multitasking
* Never went out of prototype stage

PC compatibles
* From 87 to 89, Thomson made some PC compatible machines.
* Nothing very interesting there...
* Still could not fight against Amstrad machines.

Programming
===========

CPU
---
The 6809 is the last member of the Motorola 68xx family.
Somewhat similar to the 6502, but:
* Two accumulator registers useable as a 16-bit one.
* 2 index registers
* 2 stack regusters
* Zero-page (now called Direct-page) can be moved anywhere in RAM using the DP register)
* Hardware 8bit x 8bit multiplication
* Many addressing modes (indirect, predecremented, postincremented)
* LEA instruction (like in the 68000)

Video
-----
The video is generated from two 8KB pages.
In the standard mode, one page defines 2 color numbers, and the other defines
which to use for each pixel:

AAAABBBB x 01101110 = ABBABBBA

The pixels are stored in-order.

Extra video modes introduced in the TO9:
* Bits for each pixel are split on the two pages
* a 320x200, 2-color mode with a single 8KB page
* "overprint" (one page masks or shows the other), with less colors

Hardware tricks
---------------

127 video modes
* The video generator has 7 configuration bits
* Not all mode are interesting... what can you do with them?
* It's possible to mix video modes on screen and change the palette to show more colors.
* On 1986 machines, several memory banks can be used for video display, allowing for page flip effects

60Hz and maybe overscan
* The 1986 machines introduce a 60Hz mode
* By switching between 50 and 60Hz modes, it may be possible to kill the border around the screen?

Disk access
* Various different controllers used over time (WD17xx family)
* The 1986 machines use the THMFC1, a custom Thomson chip
* The provided DOS is slow. Can you do better?

Direct-from-tape audio
* The tape drive is stereo. One track is used for data, and the other is sent to the audio output
* Music (or ads!) was played while games loaded.
* May be a good solution for running a demo with better music, without wasting CPU time for it.

Where's the trap?
-----------------
So far, this all looks amazing! (doesn't it?)
How comes the machine isn't loved more?

Problem with interrupts
* they jump to the ROM directly and can't be intercepted. Waste of time!
* One solution is to replace the ROM with a better one, for example the OS/9 system. This makes interrupts jump in RAM.

Lack of soundchip
* the 6-bit DAC and big memory is good for sampled music, but this has to be fed by the CPU. Needs synchronized code...
* One option is using the tape drive audio track instead, for zero-CPU music playing.

Sub-optimal software offer
* Bad commercial software: The IPT plan made the Thomson an edutainment computer. And these "games" are crap.
* A lot of games ported from Spectrum or Amstrad CPC, with more or less success.
* Lack of documentation: the existing ones are in French (oops!). Even use of the BASIC can be a challenge!
* Most games ran on both MO6 and TO8, not using the TO8 features (timer, more memory, ...)
* The platform was quickly abandonned by major publishers (where's Rich Dangerous? Where's Prince of Persia?), and left with only French-made games.

Hardware and software compatibility
* Many different machines, and also "minor" revisions (MO5 has two different Gate Arrays, and various motherboards and ROMs revisions)
* Slightly different memory mapping
* Very different hardware (floppy controllers, color palettes, memory size, ...)
>> Pick one machine and stick to it! (TO8 is the most common choices)

Demoscene history
=================
* In the 80s: nothing!
* In the 90s: some early experiments, mainly from the HCL group: HCL Megademo, Anima 3D
* In the 2000s: creation of the PULS group. Cross-development tools make it easier to work with Thomson machines: Chinese Stack, Space Project.
* In the 2010s: first Thomson prods entered in a demoparty compo (finally!) - at the Forever party!

Sceners on Thomson: about 10 people.
Active today: 3 to 5. We need your help! :)

Emulators
---------
MESS: the most accurate
TEO: maybe easier to use (built-in debuger,...)
dcmoto: not very accurate.

Careful: emulators are only tested with existing software. If you start poking around the hardware, don't expect them to behave 100% like the real machines.
